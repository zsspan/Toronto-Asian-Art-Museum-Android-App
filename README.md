# The Toronto Asian Art Museum now has an Android App!

The Toronto Asian Art Museum, or TAAM, is a heritage art museum located in Scarborough, Ontario. This android app was made in collaboration with the CSCB07 Software Design course at UTSC and in a group Agile/Scrum
framework. This Android app acts as a catalog manager for the museum and uses Firebase Realtime Database/Firebase storage to store museum artifacts and login/registration information.

This repo consists of a full-stack application where the backend consists of Java and uses various Android development practices such as an MVP architecture user authentication, fragment lifecycle management, XML 
modifications for enhanced UI/UX, and gradle scripts for configuration/build. The app also uses Mockito for testing purposes and Glide for media loading. This app is full of many, many features and can be 
modified/scaled to suit many purposes.
